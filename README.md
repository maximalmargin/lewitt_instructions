# lewitt_instructions

A small dataset for Sol LeWitt’s instruction-based art (75 instruction - image pairs).

Data Source: a subset of [Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/), which comprises 105 of LeWitt’s large-scale wall drawings, spanning the artist’s career from 1969 to 2007.

*What is intruction-based art?*

"Influenced by his time working in an architect’s office, LeWitt would use assistants to produce three-dimensional works he called "structures." He wrote: "An architect doesn't go off with a shovel and dig his foundation and lay every brick. He's still an artist." Instead of executing the works of art himself, LeWitt comes up with an idea or plan for his art, usually a set of simple instructions—sometimes with line drawings. He then hands over the written plan to his assistants, and they construct the work. LeWitt's instructions are both specific and open-ended so that the resulting work of art varies according to the interpretation made by the draftsperson producing the work of art." -- [Sol LeWitt’s Concepts and Structures](https://www.nga.gov/learn/teachers/lessons-activities/new-angles/sol-lewitt.html)
